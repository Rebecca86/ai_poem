        You can tell by how he lists to let her kiss him, that the getting, as
        he gets it, is good. It’s good in the sweetly salty, deeply thirsty way
        that a sea-fogged rain is good after a summer-long bout of inland
        drought. And you know it when you see it, don’t you? How it drenches
        what’s dry, how the having of it quenches. There is a grassy inlet where
        your ocean meets your land, a slip that needs a certain kind of vessel,
        and when that shapely skiff skims in at last, trimmed bright, mast
        lightly flagging left and right, then the long, lush reeds of your
        longing part, and soft against the hull of that bent wood almost im-
        perceptibly brushes a luscious hush the heart heeds helplessly— the hush
        of the very good.
